# Building-Feature-Classification
Abstract 

Three-dimensional, discontinuous, non-uniform spatial data is being collected at a rapid pace and may be stored in the form of point clouds. There has been little investigation about how machine learning techniques may be used to provide better outcomes for feature classification. The goal of my research is to gain insight into applying machine learning algorithms to classify building features.

Tools/Technologies Used: 
- Python (Numpy, pandas, matplotlib) 
- Jupyter Notebook/Deepnote
- CloudCompare
